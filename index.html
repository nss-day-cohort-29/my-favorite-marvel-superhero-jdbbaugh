    <p>Wovlerine is my favorite marvel dude because he can both be a team player and a lone wolf. His power is that his body constantly reginerates basically, making him un-killable. Because of this he was kidnapped and used as a science experiemt to become an invincible soldier.  That's how he got his metal claws.</p>
